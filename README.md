# assignment2
Refactoring my style checker into a functional programming version made me think about code structure in a new way. In the object-oriented version, I stored everything in class attributes and updated them step by step. But with functional programming, I had to split things into small, self-contained functions that donâ€™t rely on shared state. I made sure each function returned new data instead of changing anything, and used things like list comprehensions instead of loops that modify variables. I had to almost completely redo the code because I had to go back and think of everything differently, but it ended up being a lot cleaner than assignment 1. The hardest part was managing data flow between functions without relying on shared variables, but it helped me write more intentional code.
